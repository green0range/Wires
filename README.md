#About.
Wires is a top-down puzzle game, in which 'wires' are used to interact with objects, for example, a power wire connected to a door will provide power to open that door. There are other objects to extend the puzzle, such as boxes, spikes and meatuara, however wires being the main one, the game is named after them.
The game is set in a building, with each level being a new room. The storyline can be found [here](https://github.com/green0range/Wires/blob/master/assets/Untitled%201.odt) however if you wish to play the game, I recomend you keep it spoiler free.

#Development.
Early. Very early. Do not download this an expect anything to work.
Wires is developed in such a way that it will load maps and map packs, which can do basically anything with their own custom python scripts, interacting with the core program and anything else. However, the core it interacts with is currently highly unstable and feature-lacking. My development plan is to keep making more and more levels, adding features to the core as the addional levels need it. Fixing bugs and enhancing the core as needed, or as time allows. I plan to get to about 50, unque level, new features added ever few levels to keep everything fresh. I plan to go on developing solo, but you are welcome to fork this into your own project.

#License.
GPL. Once finished, I would like to sell this on Desura, however all source will always be open and completely free for those who know how to use github and run python scripts. The Desura version will have fancy lanuchers to handle all the python libs and stuff.
