"ERR001: Map data is incomplete" - Some or all of the map requirements are missing or could not be read correctly. Check with the maps creator or redownload the map/map pack you are trying to play.
"ERR002: File not found" - The game is unable to open a requested file. This could be a map, config, or save file. Check these all exist in the correct stucture, and are named correctly. Reinstall, see reinstall guide on how to do this without loosing progress.
"ERR-IN-003" - This is an internal error which should never be seen by the user. It means that a wire cannot be placed due to being over another object, it should automatically cancel placement and move on internally. If you see this something has gone horribly wrong.
